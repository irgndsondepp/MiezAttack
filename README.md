# MiezAttack

This is a little game I programmed as an excercise in 2014. It's based on the Java Game Programming Tutorial on Youtube by TheCherno.
As programming environment I used the Eclipse IDE.

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following tools installed:

- OpenJDK
- Maven
- Make (although you can use the commands from 'Makefile' directly to build and run the game without Make)

## Build the game

```bash
make build
make run
```
