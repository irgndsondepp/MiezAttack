# MiezAttack

This is a little game I programmed as an excercise in 2014. It's based on the Java Game Programming Tutorial on Youtube by TheCherno.
As programming environment I used the Eclipse IDE.

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following tools installed:

- OpenJDK
- Maven

## Build the game

```bash
mvn package
java -cp ./target/miez-attack-1.0.0.jar com.irgndsondepp.clone.Game
```
