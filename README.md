# MiezAttack

This is a little game I programmed as an excercise in 2014. It's based on the Java Game Programming Tutorial on Youtube by TheCherno.
As programming environment I used the Eclipse IDE.

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following tools installed:

- OpenJDK
- Maven
- Make (although you can use the commands from 'Makefile' directly to build and run the game without Make)

## Build the game

```bash
make build
make run
```

## Controls

Use W,A,S,D or the arrow buttons to move your character (the douchy looking guy in the trenchcoat).

Use the mouse to control the reticule and left mouse button to fire. The right mouse button is used to pickup items.

ESC exits the game at any point.

SPACE or ENTER is used in the menus to confirm your choice.
