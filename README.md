This is a little game I programmed as an excercise in 2014. It's based on the Java Game Programming Tutorial on Youtube by TheCherno.
As programming environment I used the Eclipse IDE.

Initial Check-In:
-As of now not all audio files are being uploaded. I used a lot of OpenSource stuff but because I'm stupid I never jotted down who the files belonged to...

TODO:
-Clean up files.
-Find out who recorded the OpenSource sounds.
-Build script.
